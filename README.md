Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📚 Overview
This project explores the Titanic dataset to identify survival patterns among passengers using statistical summaries and visualizations.

📋 What I Did
Loaded and inspected the Titanic dataset.
Cleaned missing values (Age, Embarked).
Generated summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation).
Created visualizations:
Histograms and Boxplots for numerical features.
Pairplot for feature relationships.
Correlation matrix heatmap.
Made basic feature-level inferences from visuals (e.g., survival rates were higher for younger passengers and 1st class).
